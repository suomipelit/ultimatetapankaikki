   - Keytronics(c) keyboard

   - Gravis Ultrasound and 100% compatibles
   - Pro Audio Spectrum (many models)
   - Windows Sound System (Crystal / Analog Codec) and 100% compatibles

2. Game info:

   VESA 2:
     It's time for SVGA !!!! But only with VESA 2 (lfb) :(
     If you don't have VESA 2, TK will run in normal 320*200 mode.
     If your system has VESA 2, TK will automatically detect it
     and run the game in 320*240 resolution (if found).
     If you have VESA 2 but you want to run the game in 320*200 mode
     use parameter "-v" (game -v).

     HINT: If yer video card is not VESA 2 and ya wanna feel the SVGA,
           use UNIVBE (Scitech Display Doctor nowadays) :)

   Features:
   - IPX network game for 8 players max !!!!!
   - 2 player game in split screen !!!
   - Beautiful graphics including COOL lightning effects.
   - Fantastic Music played on several channels.
   - DOOMistic sounds played on four sound channels.
   - Excellent game play.
   - Several different levels to play through.
   - It's error free!

   Keys:
     Move and fire keys are selectable (in OPTIONS MENU).
     Row below function keys: Selects weapon (not in SPLIT SCREEN) 
     SPACE: Map
     F: Shows frame speed & wastetime counter at screen
        If frame speed is under 40 (30-35) run SETUP and lower the sound
        quality and turn off the lights and shadows from game options. 
        If it's still not 40 try on faster PC. 
        The more wastetime the faster computer ya have (should be over 1).

     F12: Captures screen and saves it to pcx file
     ESC: Quit (just in case you are a complete jerk)

   Goal:
    - Kill 'em.
    - Collect things from playground
    - Do it fast.
    - Do shopping. It's not necessary but helps a lot.
